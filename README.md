# README

## Project dependencies:
- matplotlib
- pandas
- seaborn
I think that's it, but I have a bad cold right now and am suffering slightly from brain fog. If you run anything and get an error that you don't have a library, that is telling.

## How to navigate this project

You will find in here:
- VNA FS/TDR csv files
- env csv file up with humidty, adc_thresh, etc. until Nov 20th
- wire_temp_to_csv.py
- nts jupyter notebook

In order to reformat the env csv file, I first ran the wire_temp_to_csv.py script, you don't need to run it again unless the enviornmental csv file been updated.

Then, you run the jupyter notebook. It's quite straight forward and commented.
